Today at the Open Source Summit in Austin Texas we are excited to announce that [OPI](https://opiproject.org) has joined the Linux Foundation as a project and that IPDK will join as an official sub-project.  IPDK will continue with its charter of open source development where anyone can contribute through Github and through the [IPDK.io](https://ipdk.io) website.  As a sub-project of OPI the governance of IPDK including technical steering will come from OPI.

Once the video is posted we will include it as well.  This is an exciting development that helps us build consensus and continue to assemble the right pieces in open source for programmable infrastructure.
